## Tree Identification Tool

You can use this simple **Javascript** function to identify a tree by its characteristics.

```
function identify_tree(leaf_shape, region) {
    if (leaf_shape == "needle" && region == "cold")
           return "Pine tree" 
        } else if (leaf_shape == "broad" && region == "temperate") 
           return "Oak Tree"
        } else { 
            return "Unknown Tree"
        }    
} 
console. log(identify_tree("needle"))  
```
