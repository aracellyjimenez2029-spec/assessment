1. When collaborating with a classmate you have to make a main and then make your own branch from that. It's important to do this so you don't work on the same thing and to not mess up the work.

2. Developers use branches to work on sepreate tasks while still completing one big project

3. Git is something that developers use to take a snapshot of their code and what that code looks like at the moment. It's a disturbed control system where every developer has access to.
Git hub is a cloud based service that allows developers to store, track, manage, and control changes to their code.

4. `git add .` needs to go first and not `git commit -m "saving work"`
It needs to be like this:
```
git add .
git commit -m "saving work "
git push
```
